Create dummy clients, and launch the real server

what to test:
1. the server accepts connections
	- single client
		- connect succeeds
		-> it probably checks the protocol too?
	- multiple clients

2. the server accepts text
	- single client
		- send succeed
	- multiple clients

3. server answers simple GET requests, with shutdown WR
	- client sends all at once
		- client receives a response
		- client checks syntax of response
		- client checks content of response
		-> different file types

4. hanging?
	- clients sends part of a valid request, then stops/crashes
